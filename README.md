Yori Jori is a platform where users can share their food recipes and search other recipes by ingredients/dish name/user name. "My Kitchen" has a refrigerator which can store ingredients and show recommended dishes. This allows the user to synchronize his real fridge to the virtual one and quickly find what he can make with his current ingredients. Yori Jori also features "My YoriBook", which includes the user's own recipes as well as the recipes he saved or uploaded by others that he follows.
