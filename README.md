Yori Jori is a platform where a user can share his food recipe and search recipes by other users by the ingredients/food name/user name. "My Kitchen" has a refrigerator which can store ingredients and show recommended recipes on the drawer. This allows the user to synchronize his real fridge to the virtual one and quickly find what he can make with his current ingredients. Yori Jori also features "My YoriBook" which not only displays the recipes the user has posted, but also the recipes "scooped" by the user or uploaded by other users that the current user is following.
